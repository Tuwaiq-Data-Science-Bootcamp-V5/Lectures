    "Logistic Regression is the almost the most classification algorithm used in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for binary classification problems. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression one. It is commonly used when the dependent variable is binary, meaning it has only two possible outcomes. The algorithm models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the data that don't represent the true underlying patterns. As a result, an overfit model performs well on the training set but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model fits the training data closely, capturing even the noise.\n",
    "2. It may have high complexity, with too many parameters or features.\n",
    "3. Performance on the training set is excellent, but it fails to generalize to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Underfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. As a result, it performs poorly on both the training set and new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The model fails to capture the underlying trends in the data.\n",
    "2. It may be too simple, with too few parameters or features.\n",
    "3. Poor performance on both training and validation/test sets.\n",

    "Finding the right balance between overfitting and underfitting is crucial for building a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data. This often involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect more data : To reduce noice data and gereanlize the dataset perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature engineering : Create new features or select the best features again.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regularization : Reduce the size of wights (parameters).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ensemble methods : Another type of learning (we will discuss this concept later).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Cross-validation : Another method of evaluating the models (we will discuss this later)."

    "\n",
    "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. The purpose of regularization is to discourage the learning algorithm from fitting the training data too closely, especially when the model is complex and has a large number of parameters. This helps improve the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data."

    "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization ability of a model. Overfitting occurs when a model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise or random fluctuations that don't represent the true underlying patterns in the data. Regularization addresses this issue by adding a penalty term to the model's loss function, discouraging the learning algorithm from fitting the training data too well."
